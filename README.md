# Volunteers-Android

## Introduction

Volunteers Android  is a mobile application which helps to manage the Volunteers at an event. We want to provide Systersâ€™s affinity groups a method of collaborating, organizing, and promoting their individual events (i.e. meetups, local workshops, etc). Systers can register, login, and volunteer for events in their local city.


Learn more about the Systers organisation and it's open source development team [here](http://anitaborg.org/get-involved/systers/).

## Troubleshooting/Issues

If there are any problems encountered when installing the IDE, you may want to check and make sure you have a JDK and JRE installed. If you experience trouble building or running the project, you may not have the necessary build tools, which you can download directly through the IDE. If the app does not run on the emulator, it may be that the emulator is too slow, and you should look into installing one from an outside source.

If there are any other questions or concerns, you can join #vola channel in our slack group.
